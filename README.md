File Renamer Ultra 2000 (Windows)

File Renamer Ultra 2000 (originally called "A Program That Renames A Whole Bunch Of Files At Once") was a commercial product developed by me and a friend from 1998-2005. My military deployments and my friend and business partner cleaning the business account and disappearing led to the demise of this enterprise.

Since then, I released FRU2000 as freeware with the registration mechanism removed.

The instructions to install FRU2000 are contained in the zip file.
Runs on Windows 9x through 10.
